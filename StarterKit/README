These 3 files contain everything you need to 
teach a little music through BINGO!  

The file: TrebleClefBingo.pdf contains 25 
different BINGO cards.  Print them out on
yellow card stock, print the Notes.pdf on
another color (orange?) and print a few
copies of the pieces.pdf on a color like
blue.  Then find your scissors and take
it from there ...

More coming soon.  Hope you enjoy!
